My goal with this project is to create a modular website in which I can add new content remotely without having to re-create existing content.","overview":"This ePortfolio project is a modernized redesign of my old ePortfolio. My primary goal with the redesign was to create a modular system in which I could quickly add new projects as needed. In order to achieve this, I implemented a MEAN stack, without the Angular framework. The core structure of the site is built around AJAX principles. I created a boilerplate page that sends calls to my backend server for project specific information. One the information is received, the client constructs the page. Another design approach would be to statically generate pages server-side every time a page is updated. The project document in the embedded database would store a hash of the generated page. Every time the server starts it would iteratively check this hash and generate pages for any updated project. The up-side to this is that it helps with client-side rendering times, which helps improve the user experience and SEO. The downside would be server-side performance, as you would also be regenerating pages every time an update was applied via the API.","features":"Modular, Lightweight frontend, AJAX rendering, API layers","challenges":"My primary challenges with this project had to do with AJAX rendering, as well as the particle generation. For AJAX rendering, I had to create a system to check if the project existed, before serving the shell page. My approach to overcoming this challenge was to passthrough database functionality to the route that was performing the check. If everything was validated, then the route would serve the shell page to begin rendering. \n Particle generation was challenging, as I wanted to do it on my own without external libraries. In the legacy version of my portfolio, I utilized ParticleJS. Most of the challenge was figuring out the math to get isometric shapes, while also ensuring that the movement wasn't too overpowering.
